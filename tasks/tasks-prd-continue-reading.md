# Task List: Continue Reading Feature

## Relevant Files

- `frontend/src/hooks/useContinueReading.ts` - Custom hook for managing localStorage reading progress and API integration.
- `frontend/src/components/ContinueReadingSection.tsx` - Component that displays the Continue Reading section on the homepage.
- `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Main homepage component that will integrate the Continue Reading section.
- `frontend/src/pages/ReaderPage.tsx` - Reader component that will update progress when navigating between chapters.
- `frontend/src/lib/localStorage.ts` - Utility functions for localStorage operations and data validation.
- `frontend/src/types/continueReading.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for Continue Reading data structures.

### Notes

- The Continue Reading feature primarily involves frontend localStorage management and API integration.
- No backend changes are required as this feature uses existing manga and chapter endpoints.
- Testing will focus on localStorage operations, component rendering, and user interactions.
