# PRD: Continue Reading Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The Continue Reading feature allows users to quickly resume reading manga from where they left off, addressing the lack of user authentication and bookmarking capabilities in the current system. This feature uses localStorage to persist reading progress locally, enabling users to maintain their reading history across browser sessions without requiring an account.

## Goals

1. Provide users with a way to resume reading manga without authentication
2. Display the 6 most recently read manga series with visual progress indicators
3. Maintain reading progress data locally using browser localStorage
4. Integrate seamlessly with the existing HomePage UI design
5. Handle edge cases gracefully (cleared localStorage, unavailable manga)

## User Stories

1. **As a manga reader**, I want to see my recently read manga on the homepage so that I can quickly continue where I left off.

2. **As a manga reader**, I want to see a progress bar showing how much of each manga series I've completed so that I know my reading progress at a glance.

3. **As a manga reader**, I want the Continue Reading section to only appear when I have reading history so that the interface isn't cluttered for new users.

4. **As a manga reader**, I want to click on a Continue Reading item and be taken directly to the chapter I was reading so that I can resume immediately.

5. **As a manga reader**, I want my reading progress to update automatically when I finish a chapter so that my Continue Reading list stays current.

## Functional Requirements

1. **localStorage Data Structure**: The system must store reading progress data in localStorage with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "continueReading": [
       {
         "mangaId": "string",
         "mangaTitle": "string",
         "mangaSlug": "string",
         "lastChapterId": "string",
         "lastChapterNumber": "number",
         "lastChapterTitle": "string",
         "totalChapters": "number",
         "completedChapters": "number",
         "coverImage": "string",
         "lastReadTimestamp": "ISO string"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Progress Tracking**: The system must update localStorage when a user navigates to the next chapter, recording their progress through the manga series.

3. **Progress Bar Calculation**: The system must calculate progress percentage as: (completedChapters / totalChapters) Ã— 100.

4. **Display Logic**: The system must only show the Continue Reading section when localStorage contains at least one manga entry.

5. **Recent Items Management**: The system must maintain only the 6 most recently read manga, removing older entries when the limit is exceeded.

6. **Duplicate Handling**: The system must update existing manga entries with new progress rather than creating duplicates.

7. **Navigation**: The system must navigate users to the beginning of the last chapter they were reading when they click a Continue Reading item.

8. **Error Handling**: The system must redirect users to a 404 page if they click on a Continue Reading item for manga that no longer exists, and remove that entry from localStorage.

9. **UI Integration**: The system must replace the existing mock Continue Reading data with real data from localStorage while maintaining the current visual design.

10. **Data Refresh**: The system must validate and refresh manga data when loading the Continue Reading section by fetching current manga information from the API to update total chapter counts and recalculate progress percentages for manga that have been updated since the user last read them.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. User authentication or server-side progress storage
2. Cross-device synchronization of reading progress
3. Reading progress within individual pages of a chapter
4. Bookmarking or favoriting manga (separate from reading progress)
5. Reading time tracking or analytics
6. Social features or sharing reading progress
7. Backup or export of reading history

## Design Considerations

- **Visual Consistency**: Maintain the existing Continue Reading carousel design and styling
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the component remains mobile-friendly as per current implementation
- **Loading States**: Handle loading states gracefully while fetching manga data to validate localStorage entries
- **Empty States**: Hide the Continue Reading section entirely when no reading history exists

## Technical Considerations

- **localStorage Limits**: Monitor localStorage usage to prevent quota issues (typical limit is 5-10MB)
- **Data Validation**: Validate localStorage data structure and handle corrupted data gracefully
- **Performance**: Efficient lookup and update operations for the 6-item limit
- **Integration Points**: Hook into the existing navigation system and manga reader components
- **API Integration**: Coordinate with existing backend API endpoints to validate manga availability

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Increase in user session duration and page views per session
2. **Return Visits**: Increase in returning users (measured via analytics if available)
3. **Feature Usage**: Track clicks on Continue Reading items to measure adoption
4. **Error Rate**: Minimize 404 redirects due to unavailable manga (<5% of clicks)
5. **Performance**: Continue Reading section loads within 100ms of homepage load
