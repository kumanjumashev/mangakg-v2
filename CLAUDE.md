# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MangaKG is a manga reading application built with a React TypeScript frontend and a planned Django backend. The frontend uses Vite for development and building, with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Architecture

### Frontend Structure
- **Technology Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Main Framework**: Single-page application using React Router for navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, localStorage for theme persistence
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom manga-themed color palette
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives

### Key Directories
- `/frontend/src/pages/` - Page components (HomePage, CataloguePage, MangaDetailsPage, ReaderPage, etc.)
- `/frontend/src/components/` - Reusable components (Header, MangaCard, MangaCarousel)
- `/frontend/src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui component library
- `/frontend/src/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `/frontend/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `/frontend/src/assets/` - Static assets including manga covers

### Backend Structure
- **Technology Stack**: Django 5.0+ + PostgreSQL + Django REST Framework + Poetry + Fly.io Tigris Storage
- **Status**: Planned implementation with comprehensive requirements documented
- **Database**: Neon.tech PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development
- **Storage**: Fly.io Tigris S3-compatible storage for manga pages and covers
- **Key Models**: Series, Chapter, Page, Author, Artist, Category, Alias with approval workflow
- **Admin Interface**: Django admin with custom file upload processing and approval system

## Development Commands

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev          # Start development server on port 8080
npm run build        # Production build
npm run build:dev    # Development build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Environment Configuration

#### Separate Development and Production Environments
The project maintains strict separation between development and production environments:

**Development Environment:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:8080` (Vite dev server)
- Backend: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (Django runserver)
- Database: Local SQLite (`/backend/db.sqlite3`) 
- Configuration: Uses Vite proxy (`/api` â†’ `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)
- Data: Local test manga data for development

**Production Environment (Fly.io):**
- Frontend: `https://mangakg-frontend.fly.dev`
- Backend: `https://mangakg-backend.fly.dev`
- Database: Production database (PostgreSQL or separate SQLite)
- Configuration: Direct HTTPS API calls
- Data: Live production manga data

#### Environment Files:
- `.env.local`: Development environment (uses proxy, local backend)
- `.env.production`: Production environment (direct Fly.io backend)
- `fly.toml`: Production deployment configuration with environment variables

#### API Configuration Logic:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || (
  import.meta.env.PROD 
    ? 'https://mangakg-backend.fly.dev/api'  // Production
    : '/api'                                 // Development (proxy)
);
```

### Frontend Testing Protocol with Playwright MCP
After making any frontend changes, always conduct comprehensive testing using Playwright MCP:

#### Visual Testing
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (ensure dev server is running)
- Take screenshots of directly affected pages and their dependencies only
- Test responsive design at specific viewport sizes: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1440px (desktop)
- Verify theme switching (dark/light mode) functionality and visual consistency
- Check component rendering and layout integrity
- Save all screenshots to `tmp_files/screenshots/` directory for comparison

#### Functional Testing
- Test all modified features and user interactions on affected pages and dependencies
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors during testing
- Monitor network requests to verify API calls are functioning correctly
- Verify that existing features on tested pages weren't broken by changes

#### Testing Workflow
1. Start dev server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
2. Open browser with Playwright MCP to `http://localhost:8080`
3. Resize browser to test at 375px, 768px, and 1440px viewports
4. Navigate through directly affected pages and their dependencies
5. Take screenshots and save to `tmp_files/screenshots/` directory
6. Interact with all modified features to ensure functionality
7. Monitor browser console for errors and network tab for API calls throughout testing
8. Test theme switching on affected pages
9. Document any console errors, network issues, or functional problems found

### Backend Development
```bash
cd backend
poetry run python manage.py runserver     # Start Django development server
poetry run python manage.py migrate       # Run database migrations
poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser  # Create admin user
poetry run python manage.py test reader   # Run backend tests
poetry run python manage.py collectstatic # Collect static files for production
```

#### Health Check Endpoints
- `/` - Root endpoint: `{"service": "mangakg-backend", "status": "running", "message": "API available at /api/"}`
- `/api/health/` - Main health check endpoint (with trailing slash)
- `/api/health` - Alternative health check endpoint (without trailing slash)
- Health endpoints return: `{"status": "healthy", "service": "mangakg-backend"}`
- Optimized for fast response times (<5ms) for Fly.io health checks
- Root endpoint prevents 404 errors during health monitoring

### Installation
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install          # Install dependencies

# Backend (when implemented)
cd backend
poetry install                   # Install Python dependencies via Poetry
poetry run python manage.py migrate  # Set up database
```

## Code Conventions

### Styling
- Uses custom manga-themed color palette defined in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Dark mode is the default theme, managed through localStorage and CSS classes
- Custom CSS variables for manga-specific colors (manga-primary, manga-dark, etc.)

### Component Structure
- Functional components with TypeScript
- Uses React Router for navigation between pages
- TanStack Query for data fetching (currently using mock data)
- Components follow shadcn/ui patterns and conventions

### File Organization
- Page components are in `/pages/` directory
- Reusable UI components in `/components/`
- All shadcn/ui components in `/components/ui/`
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Backend Code Structure
- Django models in `/backend/reader/models.py` with proper constraints and relationships
- Admin interface in `/backend/reader/admin.py` with custom upload processing
- API views in `/backend/reader/views.py` using Django REST Framework
- File processing utilities in `/backend/reader/utils.py` for zip extraction and validation
- Custom validators in `/backend/reader/validators.py` for security checks

   - Set up TanStack Query for API state management
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for API responses

2. **Replace Mock Data**
   - Update HomePage to use `/api/series/` endpoint
   - Update CataloguePage with real search and filtering
   - Update MangaDetailsPage to use `/api/series/<slug>/chapters/`
   - Update ReaderPage to use `/api/chapters/<id>/pages/`

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement caching strategy with appropriate stale times
   - Add preloading for next 3 manga pages
   - Add search debouncing (300ms)
   - Handle large chapter lists with pagination

## Notes
- Project was initially created with Lovable platform
- Uses Bun lockfile (`bun.lockb`) but npm commands work fine
- ESLint configured with React and TypeScript rules
- No test framework currently configured
- Backend implementation completed and ready for integration
- Frontend API integration requirements in `/tasks/prd-frontend-api-integration.md`
- You are in YOLO mode, so after completing a task and its sub-tasks, move on to the next one without asking human intervention
- The project is simple, do not install OS packages. Just use Python/Typescript libs
- **MANDATORY**: After any frontend changes, use Playwright MCP to conduct both visual and functional testing of all affected pages and features before considering the task complete
